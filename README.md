# MESNET: 2 DIMENSIONAL FRAME ANALYZER WITH MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD #

Mesnet is a structural analysis program that is used to calculate bending force, bending moment, and deflections in 2 dimensional frames. Although it is designed for two dimensional ship frames, it is able to solve many bending problems in many engineering areas. It is free and open-sourced and licensed with GPL.

It calculates shear force, bending moment and stress distributions on the beams and determines if the current construction is safe according to given maximum allowable stress. The program implements Moment Distribution Method (or Cross Method) to solve given 2-dimensional frame.

It allows variable inertias on the beam.
