Mesnet is a structural analysis program that is used to calculate bending force, bending moment, and deflections in 2 dimensional frames. Although it is designed for two dimensional ship frames, it is able to solve many bending problems in many engineering areas.

It calculates shear force, bending moment and stress distributions on the beams and determines if the current construction is safe according to given maximum allowable stress.
